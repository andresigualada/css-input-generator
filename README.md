CSS Input Generator

What is this?
A css input generator to create css3 inputs fast and easy. It's still simple, but I will be improving though.

How to use it?
Fill the customize form and see the result real-time. You can choose a css scope (.widget by default) to limit the css code to a certain portion of the page, and css selector (.fancy by default). Once finished, press "Generate CSS" to see css code created. After that, just copy and paste to your css file.
